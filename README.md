# 🚀 Learning Git – My Journey Begins

Hi there! 👋  
Welcome to my little corner of Git experiments.  
This repo is my **practice playground** for learning:

- 📌 Git basics (add, commit, push, pull)
- 🌿 Working with branches
- 🗑 Deleting and restoring files
- 🔄 Rebasing and merging
- 🐛 Fixing mistakes (yes, there will be many!)
